Thank you for your support and guidance. I am ready to generate the session summary and update the API documentation.
This is a multi-step process, in which you prompt me for additional information and the old API documentation:

**Instructions for Generating a Session Summary and Updating API Documentation:**

1. **Initial Summary Generation:**
    - Highlight the key accomplishment of this session (e.g., we finally gave our engine a real name, "Rocket").
    - Recap the relevant questions that came up and how we addressed them (or did not).
    - Summarize what we did, where we struggled, and what needs improvement.
    - Note any remarkable discussions, notes, memos, or remindersâ€”on-topic or off-topic, fun or not.
    - Formulate a consolidated git commit message.

2. **Interactive Summary Creation:**
    - Prompt me to provide additional information about the state of the application:
        - Is everything working as expected?
        - Are there any bugs or issues that need attention?
    - Wait for my response with the additional details.

3. **Generate the Session Summary:**
    - Based on the initial instructions and the additional information provided, generate the session summary without
      including the API documentation updates.

4. **Follow-up for API Documentation Updates:**
    - Prompt me to send the old API documentation that needs to be updated.
    - Identify any objects, classes, and functions encountered during the session that are not described in the provided
      API documentation.
    - Update the API documentation accordingly.

Please start by asking me for additional information about the current state of the application to make a full summary
report.
