### Potential Issues and Improvements

#### 1. Scene Independence

**Issue**: The current implementation of the `SceneDirector` directly instantiates `LayerManager` and `CameraManager`
for each scene. This tight coupling reduces flexibility and makes the system less modular.
**Improvement**: Ensure scenes can create their own `LayerManager` and `CameraManager` independently.
The `SceneDirector` should focus solely on managing scene stacks and transitions, while each scene should handle its own
initialization.

#### 2. LayerManager `renderAll` Method Usage

**Issue**: The `renderAll` method in `LayerManager` is not fully utilized, leading to potential code duplication and
less maintainable code.
**Improvement**: Utilize the `renderAll` method in the `CanvasRenderer` to centralize the rendering logic, ensuring all
layers are rendered efficiently and consistently.

#### 3. Error Handling in Rendering

**Issue**: The error handling in the `CanvasRenderer`'s `render` method could be more robust, providing more detailed
error messages or fallback behavior.
**Improvement**: Enhance error handling with more specific messages and potential recovery or fallback mechanisms to
ensure the renderer can handle unexpected issues gracefully.

#### 4. LayerManager Initialization

**Issue**: Layers within the `LayerManager` are currently added by creating new instances directly. This approach might
limit the ability to customize layer initialization.
**Improvement**: Consider allowing layers to be initialized with additional configuration parameters or through a
factory method pattern to provide more flexibility in layer creation.

#### 5. Canvas Overlap and Interaction

**Issue**: Overlapping canvases might intercept user interactions meant for underlying canvases, which could affect
gameplay and user experience.
**Improvement**: Use the `pointer-events: none` CSS property for non-interactive layers to allow interactions to pass
through to the intended layers.

#### 6. ECS Component Lifecycle Management

**Issue**: The current ECS implementation does not have a standardized lifecycle management for components, which can
lead to inconsistent states.
**Improvement**: Define standard lifecycle methods for components (e.g., `onAdd`, `onRemove`, `update`, `render`) and
ensure they are consistently called by the `EntityManager` or the `Entity` class.

#### 7. Optimization of Spatial Queries

**Issue**: The spatial queries in the `EntityManager` could be optimized for performance, especially in large game
worlds.
**Improvement**: Implement more efficient spatial data structures, such as quadtrees or spatial hash grids, to improve
the performance of spatial queries and entity management.

#### 8. Documentation and Example Enhancements

**Issue**: The current documentation provides a basic overview but lacks detailed examples and usage scenarios.
**Improvement**: Enhance documentation with detailed examples, usage scenarios, and best practices to help developers
better understand and utilize the engine's features.

### Summary and Recommendations

The Rocket Game Engine is designed with flexibility and modularity in mind, but there are several areas where
improvements can be made to enhance its robustness and usability. The key issues identified include tight coupling in
scene management, underutilization of the `LayerManager`'s rendering capabilities, and potential inefficiencies in
spatial queries. By addressing these issues, we can improve the overall performance, maintainability, and developer
experience.

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Decouple Scene Initialization**: Refactor the scene initialization process to allow scenes to create and manage
   their own `LayerManager` and `CameraManager`. This will make the system more modular and flexible.

2. **Utilize `renderAll` in `LayerManager`**: Modify the `CanvasRenderer` to use the `renderAll` method of
   the `LayerManager`, centralizing the rendering logic and ensuring consistency across all layers.

3. **Enhance Error Handling**: Improve the error handling in the `CanvasRenderer` to provide more detailed error
   messages and potential fallback mechanisms.

4. **Standardize ECS Component Lifecycle**: Define and implement standard lifecycle methods for ECS components to ensure
   consistent state management across all components.

5. **Optimize Spatial Queries**: Implement more efficient spatial data structures to improve the performance of spatial
   queries and entity management.

6. **Enhance Documentation**: Expand the documentation with detailed examples, usage scenarios, and best practices to
   help developers fully leverage the engine's capabilities.

7. **Address Canvas Interaction Issues**: Use CSS properties like `pointer-events: none` for non-interactive layers to
   ensure proper user interaction with the intended canvases.

By prioritizing these improvements, we can significantly enhance the functionality and usability of the Rocket Game
Engine, making it a more powerful tool for game developers.
