### Session Summary

**Key Accomplishment:**
We significantly advanced the game engine by creating a robust asset management system, including binary packaging and
logging capabilities. We also set the groundwork for an interactive terminal for real-time command execution.

**Relevant Questions and Solutions:**

- **Parallel Asset Loading**: Discussed and implemented parallel loading using `Promise.all`.
- **Binary Asset Management**: Created the `BinaryManager` to package and manage assets efficiently.
- **Terminal Logging**: Implemented a `Terminal` class to log messages and update specific log entries.

**Summary of Activities:**

- **AssetManager Enhancements**:
    - Implemented methods to load images, sounds, and JSON.
    - Added support for loading assets from binary packages.
    - Integrated an event bus to emit loading events.
    - Added progress and completion handlers.

- **BinaryManager**:
    - Developed methods to create and manage binary asset packages.
    - Added functionality to retrieve binary paths for asset loading.

- **EventBus**:
    - Created a simple event bus to handle and emit events related to asset loading.

- **Terminal Logging**:
    - Developed a `Terminal` class to log messages, update progress, and execute commands.
    - Added an input field for real-time command execution.

- **ExampleScene**:
    - Demonstrated loading assets using the `AssetManager`.
    - Integrated the `Terminal` for logging and command execution.

**Struggles and Improvements Needed:**

- Initially, understanding and implementing parallel asset loading.
- Ensuring smooth integration between the `AssetManager`, `BinaryManager`, and `Terminal`.
- Balancing the complexity of features while maintaining simplicity and readability.

**Remarkable Discussions and Notes:**

- Discussed the importance of modular design and separation of concerns.
- Explored various ways to log and interact with the game in real-time.
- Emphasized the need for a scalable and maintainable architecture.

**Consolidated Git Commit Message:**
